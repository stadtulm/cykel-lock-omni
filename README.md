cykel-lock-omni
===============

This service connects [cykel](https://github.com/stadtulm/cykel) with an Omni Bluetooth/GSM Bike Lock.

The code implements just the first needed parts to connect and open a lock. Positioning, storing the user who rents (for unlocking with BLE), Firmwareupdates etc. are not implemented yet and may appear soon.

## Prerequisites

* Python (â‰¥3.7)

## Installation

Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. It is recommended to use a virtualenv with your choice of tool, e.g. `pipenv`, in which case you can run `pipenv install` (and `pipenv shell` or prefix `pipenv run` to run commands).

## Configuration

cykel-lock-omni is configured with environment variables. You may want to create a `.env` file, which you can `source .env` before running `server.py`.

The following envionment variables are needed:
```
export HOST=127.0.0.1
export PORT=8002
export LOCK_HOST=10.0.0.10
export LOCK_PORT=9679
export ENDPOINT="https://<your cykel host>/api/bike/updatelocation"
export ENDPOINT_AUTH_HEADER="Api-Key <your api key for cykel>"
```

`HOST` and `LOCK_HOST` can be two different ip addresses which cykel-lock-omni binds to. This can be used to bind the http interface for the communication with cykel only to localhost, if cykel is running on the same machine. 

For the cykel API Key (`ENDPOINT_AUTH_HEADER`), visit your cykel administrative interface and create a new API key.

### Configuration (Lock)
For configuring the lock to use your cykel-lock-omni instance, use the provided _BleTool Android App_ and press the _Set IP_ menu entry.
